# DWD Infinite Scroll

### Assignment notes:
 
All relevant project code is contained with the `Code` directory.

When viewing the project in the editor, the CardManager will allow you to specify the amount of cards displayed in our card display when Play Mode is entered.

Additional card sprites can be created easily in two steps:

- Enter the Sprite Editor and crop new cards from the master Card sprite sheet in the Graphics folder.
- Add new card's suit/value/face sprite to the Cards Array in the Card Manager.
